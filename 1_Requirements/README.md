###### INTRODUCTION
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper .

Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems. The concept of this wiper system is similar with other conventional wiper, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller. Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.

In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different concept and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or even mud [2]. It worked by reflecting harmonious light beams within the windscreen. When raindrops fall onto the windscreen, this harmony light is been disturbed and creating a drop in the light beam intensity. The system then activated the wipers to be operated in full automatic mode. It has a response time at 0.1 seconds. It allowed for a quick reaction when it is a sudden splashes of water that will make the driver totally ‘blinds’ when the situation happened. With the automatic wiper, the driver can avert from the risk of an accident. The automatic wiper is important during the heavy traffic e.g. in town, city, school zone and other public place. A driver may be subjected to many distractions with bad weather, dangerous road conditions and fatigue. The Rain Sensor reduced the driver’s burden by making the driving more comfortable. Trailing a wet car is no longer a nuisance as detection of even 0.005 milliliters of water is possible.

###### Features :-
1.It shall lock the car when button is pressed ONCE.

2.It shall open the car when button is pressed TWICE.

3.It shall wiper on and it moves clock wise direction when button is pressed THREE times.

4.It shall wiper off and it moves anti clock wise direction when button is pressed FOUR times.

5.It shall wiper complete one cycle when the button is pressed FIVE times.

##### Aim :-
To prevent the Accidents During rain condition

##### Research :-
Application is researched from various resources like from Google, YouTube and from Research Papers and then developed one application model called as wiper control system

##### End Goal :-
1.Avoid Accidents and Provide safety environment

2.Clean Vision in weather conditions

### 4'W1'H :-
##### Who :-
All who wants safety and clean vision in weather conditions.

##### What :-
It's a application that is Wiper Speed Control System for every vehicles

##### Why :-
Curious about intrest in embedded system applications.

##### When :-
If anyone wants to drive the car in rain condition with safety.

##### How :-
LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original condition after cleaning the windsheet of motor vehicles.
